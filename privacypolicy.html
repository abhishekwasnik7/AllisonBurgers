            <div class="privacy-p">
                <p>We do not sell your personal information and only share your information as described in this privacy statement.</p>
                <p>We may share your personal information within the Allison's Family.

These countries may not have the same level of legal data protection as the country in which you initially provided the information, but we do request such Members of the Allison’s Family who receive this information from us to not use or share the information, except as set out in this privacy statement.</p>
                <p>We may share your personal information with vendors who provide services to us, such as fulfilling orders, providing data processing and other information technology services, managing promotions, contests, prize draws and sweepstakes, carrying out research and analysis, and personalizing individual Allison’s customer experiences.

                <p>We may, for strategic or other business reasons, decide to sell or transfer all or part of our business.  As part of that sale or transfer, we may pass information we have collected and stored, including personal information, to anyone involved in the sale or transfer.</p>
                <p>There may be times where we may share information when it does not directly identify you.  For example, we may share anonymous, aggregated statistics about your use of our online services.  Or we may combine information about you with other customers and share the information in a way that does not link to a specific customer.</p>

                <h2>4. Children’s Privacy Notice</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="privacy-p">
                    <p>We understand how important it is to protect your privacy when you use our online services.  We are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit or use our online services.</p>
                    <p>This section is designed to answer your questions about how we use the personal information we collect from children under the age of 18 when they use our online services.</p>
                    <p>We offer many features on our sites, such as games and coloring books, which children do not have to provide any personal information.  However, sometimes we may collect personal information, such as an email address, a postal address or phone number, from your child as part of an activity.</p>
                    <div class="privacy-ul">
                        <ul>Here are two examples of information we collect.
                            <li>We may collect your child’s email address so that we can tell them if they have won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstake.  We will tell them using the email address they have given us. We will not keep the email address or use it for any other purpose</li>
                            <li>We may collect your child’s email address to respond to a one-off request from them, such as to send them a screen saver.  In these cases we will promptly delete their email address from our system once we have replied to them, and we will not use the address for any other purpose.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>We will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of 18 without the permission of a parent or guardian. If we need this permission, we will collect your email address so we can tell you how we use information and get your permission to collect information from your child.</p>
                    <p>We use the email address your child gives us to respond to requests or to tell them if they have won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstake they have entered.  We will use your email address to give you details about how we use personal information or to get your permission.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="privacy-h5">

                </div>
                <div class="privacy-p">
                    <p>If you have agreed to receive marketing communications from us, you can later opt out by following the opt-out instructions in the marketing communications we send you.  You can also generally find your communication preferences with instructions on how to opt out in the profile section of the online services that you use. You may also have the ability to change your communication preferences using your device settings.</p>
                    <p>If you do opt out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still send communications to you about your transactions, any accounts you have with us, and any contests, competitions, prize draws or sweepstakes you have entered.  Opting out of one form of communication does not mean you have opted out of other forms as well. For example, if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, you may still receive marketing text messages if you have opted in to receiving them.</p>
                    <p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, unless you give us permission to do so.  When we give you notice, and you consent, we will share your personal information as you direct us to.</p>
                    <p>If at any time you would like to access, correct, or delete personal information we have collected from, please contact us at the email or postal address mentioned below. In certain circumstances, including when required by applicable law, we will comply with your request. We may be required by law to retain certain information/ Before McDonald’s is able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies, we may ask you to verify your identity and/or provide other details to help us respond to your request.</p>
